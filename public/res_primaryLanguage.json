    "description": "Hi, my name is Hannah Hwang and I am a software developer. During the day, I work as a pharmacy technician at an independent pharmacy where I have been working for three years. I came to the realization that in order to continue to support myself financially in the future, I needed to make a career change. I learned about software development through friends who are in the field, and after doing some reseach and learning a bit on my own, I decided to take the step into taking classes at Code Fellows. Since I’ve always loved putting things together and problem-solving, I’m excited to have found something I could enjoy and become passionate about. I plan on utilizing the skills I have learned in my past job experiences as well as the knowledge I have gained at Code Fellows to become a more well-equipped software developer.",
